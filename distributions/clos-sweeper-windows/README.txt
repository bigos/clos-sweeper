README

This folder contains the executable: clos-sweeper.exe and the various launchers and diagnostic tools.

In case of troubles, run msys2-diagnostic-launcher.cmd, while msys2-invisible-launcher.vbs starts the msys2-launcher.cmd without showing the termnal window normally seen in scripts. But vbs files are a deprecated technology and will be removed in future versions of Windows.

How am I supposed to start my executable so that in uses gtk and cairo libraries? Please offer your suggestions.

Also I added an example shortcut that works for my location.
